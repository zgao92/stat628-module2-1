### Introduction

In this project, we analyzed Yelp reviews to determine the most important factors for guest experience at hotels. We then used this information to identify important topics in the reviews and provide useful, realistic business recommendations for hotel owners. In addition, we trained a gradient boosting model on the full dataset in order to generate score predictions for each review in the test set.
